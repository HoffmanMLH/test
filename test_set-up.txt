Login to github
Download/install GitHub desktop with default settings
https://desktop.github.com/

Clone existing repo (give more detail here, I created an initial repo)
Add/change/remove files
Commit with high level comment and additional description
push origin

Branch --> New branch


make changes/add files
commit to test branch

publishe branch

branch --> updated from default branch


Added additional code to test branch


Added more code to local



Added more code to master

does this catch?

How about this?


Commit locally, push origin to push to remote repo.

Branc, create pull request.
